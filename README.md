# STA 523 :: Project

## Requirements

1. Your project must be reproducible.

2. You should include a report using Rmarkdown detailing your project's main 
   objective, data, methods, results, and references. I should be able to set 
   `code_folding: hide` in your YAML header and easily read and 
   understand your project.

3. Your project must involve statistics.

4. You may not use data already used in this course without my approval.

5. Your project must include some aspect of R beyond what was introduced in
   this course. This can be an extension of some topic or be 
   something entirely new.

6. You must include a `Makefile` that builds your final report by
   connecting all dependencies.

## Essential details

#### Deadline and submission

**The deadline to submit your project is 8:00am on Saturday, December 14.** 
Only the content in the master branch will be graded.

#### git / GitHub

Each group will have a master branch and other branches with a GitHub name as a prefix.
One will be your GitHub name. You will only be able to push to your branch as 
the master branch is protected. To get your work into branch master 
(the only branch that will be graded), initiate a pull request on GitHub. 
This will then merge your work into the master branch upon approval by one of 
your teammates.

#### Help

- Post your general questions in the #project channel on Slack. 

- Visit the instructor or TAs in office hours.

#### Academic integrity

As a reminder, any code you use or find as 
inspiration must be cited. Include a references section in your Rmd file if
needed.
